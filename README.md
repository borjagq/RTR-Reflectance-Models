# Real-time Rendering Reflectance Models

A visualisation and comparison of Blinn-Phong, Cook-Torrance, Oren-nayar and Toon shading models in OpenGL.

## About this repo

This code delves into the intricacies of Blinn-Phong, Cook-Torrance, Oren-Nayar, and Toon shading models, providing a dynamic platform for visualizing their effects on various 3D models simultaneously. This repository not only facilitates the exploration of individual shaders but also enables real-time adjustments to shader parameters, offering an immersive experience into how these parameters influence the rendered scene, all in the context of real-time rendering for enhanced graphics applications.
